It shall be Buyer’s sole responsibility to bring any incorrect details to our attention.<br>
            <br>In addition to the foregoing, we may also contact you by phone and / or email to inform and confirm any change in the Order, due to availability or unavailability or change in Order or change in price of any item in the Order as informed by the Merchant.
